Elon Musk has made a surprise visit to China as he bids to shore up Tesla’s slumping sales and introduce the carmaker’s self-driving technology in its second biggest market in the face of ferocious competition. His second trip to the country in less than a year included a meeting Sunday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who praised Tesla as a “successful model” for US-China collaboration. The Tesla (TSLA) chief was in town to seek Beijing’s approval for the rollout of Full Self-Driving (FSD) software in China and the transfer of its data overseas, according to a Reuters report. Virtually all Teslas have a driver-assistance system called Autopilot, while the more robust FSD feature comes at a premium price. Autopilot is available in China, but not the full FSD feature, which needs to comply with the country’s data security rules. Musk appeared to have made progress on his goals during the two-day trip, which ended on Monday. On Sunday, the China Association of Auto Manufacturers said in a statement that Tesla’s Model 3 and Y vehicles had passed China’s data security requirements. Its cars had previously been barred from entering some sensitive areas in China due to spying and data security concerns. And since 2021, the company has been required to store local user data at a facility within the country because it faced scrutiny over whether its cars could ever be used for spying.Tesla has also reached a deal with Chinese tech giant Baidu (BIDU) to form a partnership on mapping and navigation functions ahead of plans to deploy the FSD system, according to a Bloomberg report.
